            Brigitte Lore
        </h3>
        <p>
            Brigitte is the youngest daughter of Torbjorn and Ingrid Lindholm, and is a traveling companion of Reinhardt Wilhelm. 
            No longer sitting on the sidelines, Brigitte Lindholm has taken up arms to defend those in need of protection.
            A Lindholm through and through, Brigitte's aptitude for engineering is matched by her sense of honor.
            She is very stubborn, a trait inherited from her father. She didn't inherit his dwarfism however, and is very tall.
            Brigitte spars with Reinhardt every day. Afterwards, she and Reinhardt go to a pub or tavern to relax. 
            She likes doughnuts, and loves semlor. Brigitte has regular workouts, but also "cheat days" where she gorges on food.
            These "cheat days" occur at her discretion. She is an amateur poet and songwriter, but apparently not a talented one.
